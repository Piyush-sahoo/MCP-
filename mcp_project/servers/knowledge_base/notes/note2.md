# MCP Protocol Overview

## What is MCP?
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for connecting AI models to external data sources and tools. It enables secure, controlled access to resources while maintaining clear boundaries.

## Key Components

### Resources
- Read-only data sources
- URI-based addressing scheme
- Support for text and binary content
- Metadata and caching support

### Tools
- Executable functions with parameters
- Input validation and error handling
- Structured response format
- Security and permission controls

### Prompts
- Reusable prompt templates
- Parameter substitution
- Context injection capabilities
- Version control and management

## Transport Protocols
- **stdio**: Standard input/output for local processes
- **HTTP/SSE**: Server-sent events for web-based communication
- **WebSocket**: Bidirectional real-time communication

## Security Model
- Capability-based permissions
- Resource access controls
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging and monitoring

## Use Cases
- AI assistants with external data access
- Automated workflow systems
- Knowledge base integration
- API orchestration and management
